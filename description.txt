Adds the Super Dummy item which can be crafted out of a Target Dummy and a Mana Crystal at a Workbench.

If you use the Item a Super Dummy spawns at your Cursor location.
The spawned Dummy works like a vanilla Target Dummy but can also be detected by Minions and homing Projectiles.

You can spawn new Dummies with Left Click and remove all Dummies with Right Click.
